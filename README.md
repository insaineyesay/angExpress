# angExpress
Starter project for angular 1.x and express 4.13.4
in your client directory run npm install.
You can use yoeman's angular generator calls to generate controllers, services directives etc. 

After npm/bower install run 'grunt serve' to start it up in the browser at port 9000. However you won't nee this after you nav to your express server in the 'server' directory. Once in there run 'npm test' for dev or 'npm start' for prod. Prod will bundle up the app and do some other things i'll add here later. 

This is a stripped build of: http://start.jcolemorrison.com/building-an-angular-and-express-app-part-1/
Thanks to that guy for making that tut.

Once you run 'npm test' from the server directory, nav to localhost:3000 to see the app being served from the server.
